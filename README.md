# pyMDA

Python based Mechanical Design Automation (MDA) or Mechanical Computer Aided Design (MCAD)

Used to output OpenSCAD files (via SolidPython)

Overall - it needs a cleanup to organise and explain parts/functions, and perhaps port to muscad

For now, started a new OO based design approach - see [new/test.py](new/test.py) for a demo of the range of built-in parts and features. Here is a brackdown with some screenshots:

Built-in Part Assembly (using OO inheritance):
