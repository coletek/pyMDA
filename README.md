# pyMDA

Python based Mechanical Design Automation (MDA) or Mechanical Computer Aided Design (MCAD)

Used to output OpenSCAD files (via SolidPython)

Overall - it needs a cleanup to organise and explain parts/functions, and perhaps port to muscad

For now, started a new OO based design approach - see new/test.py for an example
